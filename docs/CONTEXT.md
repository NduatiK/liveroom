For simplicity, let's consider that Liveroom is being used to showcase a B2B SaaS product called _MySaaS_.

There are 2 main personas in Liveroom:

- **admin**: this is the builder of the product, who wants to show a demo of his product to his client.

- **client**: this is the potential customer of the product.

Those 2 personas have access to 2 different experiences in Liveroom:

- The admin has an interface showing all the connected clients in the room. They are displayed on different screens, to respect aspect ratio. He can interact with each of them. This interface is hosted on [Liveroom](https://liveroom.app).

- The client has a minimal Liveroom interface, on top of the interface of _MySaaS_. The Liveroom interface is embedded as much as possible, for example just a little pill on the bottom of the screen.
